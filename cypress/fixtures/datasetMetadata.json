These include axial breast MRI images acquired by 1.5T or 3T scanners in the prone positions. Following MRI sequences are shared in DICOM format: a non-fat saturated T1-weighted sequence, a fat-saturated gradient echo T1-weighted pre-contrast sequence, and mostly three to four post-contrast sequences.\nLocations of lesions in DCE-MRI: Annotations on the DCE-MRI images by radiologists.\nImaging features from DCE-MRI: A set of 529 computer-extracted imaging features by inhouse software. These features represent a variety of imaging characteristics including size, shape, texture, and enhancement of both the tumor and the surrounding tissue, which is combined of features commonly published in the literature, as well as the features developed in our lab."

In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of this relationship.\nMethods We analysed a set of 922 patients with invasive breast cancer and pre-operative MRI. The MRIs were analysed by a computer algorithm to extract 529 features of the tumour and the surrounding tissue. Machine-learning-based models based on the imaging features were trained using a portion of the data (461 patients) to predict the following molecular, genomic, and proliferation characteristics: tumour surrogate molecular subtype, oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor status, as well as a tumour proliferation marker (Ki-67). Trained models were evaluated on the set of the remaining 461 patients.\nResults Multivariate models were predictive of Luminal A subtype with AUC = 0.697 (95% CI: 0.647–0.746, p < .0001), triple negative breast cancer with AUC = 0.654 (95% CI: 0.589–0.727, p < .0001), ER status with AUC = 0.649 (95% CI: 0.591–0.705, p < .001), and PR status with AUC = 0.622 (95% CI: 0.569–0.674, p < .0001). Associations between individual features and subtypes we also found.\nConclusions There is a moderate association between tumour molecular biomarkers and algorithmically assessed imaging features."
