Cell by cell, organ by organ we are developing a model of the human body. Our vision is to have this model available for anyone who wants one as part of their medical record. Data from a wide range of sources including health records, medical equipment and wearable sensors will be combined to personalise this model to be a digital twin. With this digital twin we will be better able to monitor, treat and even predict our health into the future.</p><p><br></p><p>Advances in technology and medicine have vastly improved our ability to diagnose and treat medical conditions. Medical imaging and diagnosis equipment allows us to look within the body and see how it works. We can use this data to build models of  individual cells, organs and even organ systems to increase our understanding of how they work and how disease can impact their function. The Auckland Bioengineering Institute has been at the forefront of biomedical modelling for over two decades. With the 12 Labours project we are using this modelling experience to develop a digital twin. We have identified three core areas required to develop digital twins and give the broadest use and impact.      </p><ol><li><div><p>Building more accurate models that incorporate multiple scales from cells and tissue units through to organs, and combining these organ models to build organ systems and complete digital twins.</p></div></li><li><div><p>Building interoperability, standardisation and security into our predictive modelling frameworks to allow models and data to be secure, personalised and reusable.</p></div></li><li><div><p>Increasing the sources of data available to us and the frequency at which we get data through developing and using data from wearables, implantables and point-of-care devices. </p></div></li></ol><ul><p></p></ul><p></p>"
